        "This analysis focuses on identifying and analyzing historical market cycles within the Liv-ex 100 fine wine index from 2003 to 2024. The goal is to understand bull and bear phases using signal-based methods and calculate average cycle durations and returns. This information provides predictive insight into when the next market transition is likely to occur.\n",

        "✅ Methodology Summary\n",
        "We used a systematic approach to label the wine market into bull, bear, accumulation, and distribution phases based on:\n",
        "\n",
        "Peaks and troughs (via scipy.signal.find_peaks)\n",
        "\n",
        "Moving average crossovers (50-day and 200-day)\n",

        "Fine wine tends to lag inflationary spikes but catches up in bull runs\n",

        "Current status (June 2025): Price and time indicate a high likelihood that the bear phase is nearing its end. This historically precedes a 20–30% upward move in the following ~2 years.\n",
