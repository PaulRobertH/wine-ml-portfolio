# üì¶ Wine Market Forecasting ML

Welcome to the Wine Market Forecasting project. This repository applies data science and machine learning to understand and predict the performance of fine wine indices, particularly the **Liv-ex 100**, using macroeconomic indicators like **inflation, interest rates, and equity markets**.

---

## üîç Project Overview

### üéØ Objective
To model, visualise, and forecast fine wine market trends using macroeconomic data and machine learning models for tactical allocation, risk regime awareness, and cycle-based investing.

### üß∞ Key Tools & Techniques
- Python (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Random Forest (classification + regression)
- Time-series feature engineering
- Rolling correlation, macro spreads, drawdowns
- Visual insights and ML-based prediction zones

## üìä Key Results
- Visualised correlation between CPI and Liv-ex 100
- Modelled impact of interest rates on wine returns
- Detected reversal regimes using Random Forests
- Created probability-driven entry signals (0.6+ = high reversal risk)

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open notebooks in `notebooks/`
4. Read through `reports/` for documentation

# üìò Liv-ex Fine Wine ML Pipeline: Progress Report & Roadmap

## ‚úÖ STAGE 1‚Äì2: Setup, Cleaning, Alignment (Complete)

### 1. Data Sources Ingested
We pulled and cleaned data from:

- üìà **Liv-ex 100 Index** (fine wine price proxy)
- üíµ **Macro indicators**: CPI, FX (GBP/USD, EUR), commodities (Oil, Gold), interest rates (US10Y, UK10Y)
- üßÆ **Monthly frequency** aligned using `Plot_Date`

### 2. Cleaning Steps
- Standardised all date formats
- Forward/back filled missing values
- Merged into a master DataFrame: `merged_df`
- Synced start from **Jan 2003 ‚Üí Present (2025)**


## ‚úÖ STAGE 3: Exploratory & Correlation Analysis (Complete)

### üîç Correlation Insights
- **Rolling 12-month correlations** between wine and macro factors (inflation, oil, FX, etc.)
- **Rebased comparison charts** for relative performance
- Key finding: **Wine has recently decoupled from inflation trends** ‚Äî potential opportunity


## ‚úÖ STAGE 4: Market Cycle Tagging & Analysis (Complete)

### üìâ Peak & Trough Detection
- Used `scipy.signal.find_peaks` on Liv-ex 100
- Tagged **local highs and lows**

### üìä Cycle Labeling
Each timestamp labeled as one of:

- `Accumulation` (post-trough)
- `Bull Market`
- `Distribution` (post-peak)
- `Bear Market`

### üîÑ Phase Logic
- Defined based on **moving average structure** and proximity to extrema
- Stored in `phase` column

### üìà Cycle Statistics Summary

| Metric             | Value        |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Avg Bull Duration  | ~23.2 months |
| Avg Bear Duration  | ~15.5 months |
| Avg Bull Return    | +34.97%      |
| Avg Bear Return    | ‚àí18.66%      |
| Last Trough        | ~2020-01     |
| Last Peak (ATH)    | ~2022-09     |
| Current Phase      | Bear (2025)  |
| Projected Bull Restart | ~2024-08-01 |

### üñºÔ∏è Final Cycle Chart Includes
- Liv-ex 100 price series
- 50-day & 200-day moving averages
- Peak and trough markers
- Market phase shading (bull, bear, etc.)

## üîÆ STAGE 6+: Machine Learning & Forecasting

| Stage | Goal                                                   |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|

| 7     | Use Gaussian Process Regression for cycle forecasting |
| 8     | Evaluate metrics (ROC, MAE, F1 Score, etc.)           |
| 9     | Build dashboards (Streamlit, Jupyter widgets, etc.)   |
