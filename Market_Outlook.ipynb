With the Liv-ex 100 approaching its Fibonacci 61.8% retracement level (measured from the 2015 low to the 2022 peak), historical precedent suggests the market is at or near a long-term trough.\n\nOur Machine Learning based forecasting model indicates the next bull phase is likely to initiate (this includes an expected plateau for 12 months which does not indicate a bull market but a flattening before a sign of strength) between mid- and late 2025, with a projected upswing of 20-30% over the following two years. This projection aligns with past post-bear recoveries.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Opportunity\n\n- Fine wine shows clear cyclicality — bear phases are shorter and shallower than bull runs.\n- Historically, entering near the trough has delivered compounded returns of +30-50%.\n- We believe June 2025 represents a compelling inflection point, supported by macro and technical signals.\n- Smart capital may begin reallocation, with a view to holding through to mid-2026/7 and well beyond.\n\n---\n\n## Macroeconomic Reversion & Market Timing in Fine Wine\n\nLiv-ex 100 - Multi-Factor Signal Analysis (as of June 2025)\n\nThese charts collectively illustrate the macro-driven dynamics of the Liv-ex 100 fine wine index, providing strong evidence that fine wine exhibits reversion-to-mean behaviour against inflation, as well as multi-year directional cycles post-drawdown. The implications for long-term asset allocators are significant.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Wine - CPI Gap & ML Reversion Zones\n\nThis chart tracks the 12-month performance gap between fine wine and inflation (CPI), overlaid with a machine learning model estimating rebound probability.\n\n- Reversion Zones (green shading) show periods where the model signals a statistical likelihood of wine outperforming inflation in the following 12-24 months.\n- Historically, when wine underperforms CPI by more than -0.5 (blue line), this has led to strong subsequent bull cycles.\n- As of mid-2025, we are again in such a zone, with the model forecasting a rebound probability above 0.5, indicating favourable entry conditions.\n\nThis supports the broader thesis that fine wine mean-reverts after periods of real underperformance.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Liv-ex 100 Return vs Interest Rates\n\nHere we see the 12-month rolling return of the Liv-ex 100 (blue) plotted against the US interest rate (Fed Funds proxy) in orange:\n\n- There is a strong inverse relationship: wine returns generally weaken during tightening cycles (2006-08, 2018, and 2022-24).\n- The steepest interest rate hikes (2022-2023) correspond to the current drawdown phase.\n- However, with rates now peaking and starting to roll over, the macro headwind is easing — historically a precursor to sustained wine market recovery.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Liv-ex 100 Drawdown Chart\n\nThis panel shows maximum historical drawdowns from peak levels:\n\n- Drawdowns of -20% or more are rare but significant (2008, 2014, 2023).\n- Each large drawdown has preceded a multi-year recovery, reflecting wine's lagged but stable rebound tendency.\n- The current drawdown (~-23% from 2022 peak) is already comparable to the 2008 correction, implying limited further downside and strong asymmetry to the upside.\n\n---\n\n### 4. 12M Rolling Momentum (Bottom Panel)\n\nMomentum analysis shows that once wine begins a positive trend, it typically sustains for several years:\n\n- Positive momentum periods (e.g. 2006-08, 2009-11, 2020-22) correspond to clear bull runs.\n- Negative momentum reversals tend to cluster, but once a bottom forms, momentum builds quickly and persistently.\n\nAs of June 2025, momentum is flat but potentially bottoming, consistent with the reversion signals above.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Interpretation\n\n- The current macro environment — marked by elevated CPI, peaking interest rates, and wine underperformance — closely mirrors past cycle troughs.\n- The reversion probability model, combined with drawdown magnitude and interest rate easing, strongly favours forward-looking allocations to fine wine.\n- Historically, entering at such inflection points has delivered 30-50% returns over 2-4 years, with relatively low volatility compared to equities or commodities. Once again, we expect a plateau of 12 months before a change of direction.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFine wine, as measured by the Liv-ex 100, is now exhibiting classic bottoming signals across macro, technical, and machine learning models. The case for accumulation ahead of the next cycle is statistically supported and time-tested.\n\n---\n\n## Liv-ex 100 Analysis Charts\n\nBelow are the charts referenced throughout this report. They illustrate the technical and macro signals shaping the market outlook.\n\n---\n\n### Liv-ex 100 Phase Chart\n\n![Liv-ex Phase Chart](notebooks/images/livex100_phase_chart.png)\n\n---\n\n### Liv-ex Peak Trough Custom Fibonacci Chart\n\n![Liv-ex Peak Trough Custom Fib Chart](notebooks/images/livex100_peak_trough_custom_fib_chart.png)\n\n---\n\n### Liv-ex Peak Trough Chart\n\n![Liv-ex Peak Trough Chart](notebooks/images/livex100_peak_trough_chart.png)\n\n---\n\n### Liv-ex Cycle Prediction Chart\n\n![Liv-ex Cycle Prediction Chart](notebooks/images/livex100_cycle_prediction_chart.png)\n"
