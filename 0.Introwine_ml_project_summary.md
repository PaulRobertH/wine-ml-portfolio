📦 Wine Market Forecasting ML
Welcome to the Wine Market Forecasting project. This repository applies data science and machine learning to understand and predict the performance of fine wine indices, particularly the Liv-ex 100, using macroeconomic indicators like inflation, interest rates, and equity markets.

🔍 Project Overview
🎯 Objective
To model, visualise, and forecast fine wine market trends using macroeconomic data and machine learning models for tactical allocation, risk regime awareness, and cycle-based investing.

🧰 Key Tools & Techniques
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

Random Forest Regression

Time-series feature engineering

Rolling correlation, macro spreads, drawdowns

Market cycle phase detection

ML-based trading signals and backtesting

Scenario analysis (e.g. CPI shock)

📊 Key Results
Correlation analysis of CPI, interest rates, and Liv-ex 100 returns

Market cycle tagging (Bull, Bear, Accumulation, Distribution)

Random Forest model trained to predict 12-month forward Liv-ex 100 returns

Backtesting ML-driven trading strategy:

Original Strategy CAGR ~12.36%

Scenario (+3% CPI) Strategy CAGR ~12.32%

Scenario analysis shows inflation increases volatility but does not significantly reduce long-term wine returns

⚠️ Data Location
⚠️ Important Note:

Data files for this project are not stored in GitHub. They remain dynamically updated in Google Drive because this is an ongoing project requiring flexible data updates.

Required files to run the notebooks:

merged_prepared_data_with_preds.csv → Full dataset with macro data, ML predictions, and backtest signals

backtest_results.csv → Backtest output for original strategy

scenario_preds.csv → Backtest output under +3% CPI scenario

Figures saved:

predicted_returns.png → ML predictions vs scenario predictions

scenario_backtest.png → Scenario strategy vs Buy & Hold

📘 Liv-ex Fine Wine ML Pipeline: Progress Report & Roadmap
✅ STAGE 1–2: Setup, Cleaning, Alignment (Complete)
1. Data Sources Ingested
We pulled and cleaned data from:

📈 Liv-ex 100 Index (fine wine price proxy)

💵 Macro indicators: CPI, FX (GBP/USD, EUR), commodities (Oil, Gold), interest rates (US10Y, UK10Y)

🧮 Monthly frequency aligned using Plot_Date

2. Cleaning Steps
Standardised all date formats

Forward/back filled missing values

Merged into a master DataFrame: merged_df

Synced start from Jan 2003 → Present (2025)

✅ STAGE 3: Exploratory & Correlation Analysis (Complete)
🔍 Correlation Insights
Rolling 12-month correlations between wine and macro factors (inflation, oil, FX, etc.)

Rebased comparison charts for relative performance

Key finding: Wine has recently decoupled from inflation trends — potential opportunity

✅ STAGE 4: Market Cycle Tagging & Analysis (Complete)
📉 Peak & Trough Detection
Used scipy.signal.find_peaks on Liv-ex 100

Tagged local highs and lows

📊 Cycle Labeling
Each timestamp labeled as:

Accumulation (post-trough)

Bull Market

Distribution (post-peak)

Bear Market

🔄 Phase Logic
Defined via moving average structure and proximity to extrema

Stored in phase column

📈 Cycle Statistics Summary
Metric	Value
Avg Bull Duration	~23.2 months
Avg Bear Duration	~15.5 months
Avg Bull Return	+34.97%
Avg Bear Return	−18.66%
Last Trough	~2020-01
Last Peak (ATH)	~2022-09
Current Phase	Bear (2025)
Projected Bull Restart	~2024-08-01

🖼️ Final Cycle Chart Includes
Liv-ex 100 price series

50-day & 200-day moving averages

Peak and trough markers

Market phase shading

Fibonacci retracements

Projected ML-based cycle reversal marker

✅ Data saved:

livex_cycle_data.csv: Chart data with phase labels

livex_cycle_summary.csv: Cycle statistics for ML

✅ STAGE 6: Machine Learning & Backtesting (Complete)
Model
Random Forest Regression

Target: 12-month forward return

Features:

macro variables

other Liv-ex indices

Backtesting
Strategy:

Go long if predicted return > 5%

Only during bull/accumulation phases

Results:

Original Strategy CAGR: ~12.36%

Scenario (+3% CPI) Strategy CAGR: ~12.32%

Inflation scenario increases volatility but does not destroy returns

✅ Outputs:

backtest_results.csv

scenario_preds.csv

predicted_returns.png

scenario_backtest.png

🔜 STAGE 7: Future Work (Optional)
Notebook 6 completes the core pipeline. Notebook 7 is optional for further enrichment:

Test alternative models (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM)

Analyze feature importances

Run additional macro scenarios (+5% CPI, FX shocks)

Add time-series cross-validation

Explore FX hedging for non-GBP investors

Build automated reporting dashboards

👨‍🔬 Author & Purpose
Built as part of a fine wine macro forecasting and ML analysis capstone — integrating real financial data with machine learning for insight-driven investing.
