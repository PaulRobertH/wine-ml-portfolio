        "**Name:** Wine Market Forecasting ML  \n",
        "**Version:** 1.0  \n",
        "**Date:** 2025-06-19  \n",

        "\n",
        "The Wine Market Forecasting ML model leverages macroeconomic and financial indicators to forecast trends in the fine wine market, focusing on the Liv-ex 100 index. It aims to detect shifts between bull and bear cycles, predict forward returns, and provide data-driven insights for tactical asset allocation in fine wine investing. This project is purely educational and intended as a machine learning portfolio project.\n",

Excessive consumption poses health risks, including addiction and long-term illness. This project does not promote excessive drinking or irresponsible alcohol use. Users should drink responsibly and comply with local laws.\n",

        "- Retraining recommended annually to adapt to shifting macroeconomic relationships.\n",
        "- Predictions should always be combined with domain expertise and not used in isolation for investment decisions.\n",
        "- Wine investing should not be conflated with personal alcohol consumption. This project analyses wine purely as an investment asset class.\n",

        "- Expansion to other Liv-ex indices\n",
        "- Development of dashboards (e.g. Streamlit apps)\n",
